\subsection{Adjusting Placement for Each Move}

Our Jigsaw puzzle approach turns out to be a big success. We started to seek for an improvement over that.

We thought a possible ``problem" of that approach is, we only consider the perimeter change for the residence or factory that we are building.
It may be a good idea that, for every possible placement of buildings, we first construct the road, ponds and parks if necessary or applicable. 
Then we choose the best one by considering the perimeter change of all objects, and the number of disconnected components it creates.

Surprisingly this attempt failed. The average score of 50 runs over random sequencer decreases by almost 200. Also statistics shows a decrease on
score per water/park cell. We began to realize that it is no good to pursue the regularity above some certain point. 
The reason behind may be, the roads, ponds and fields should be more ``exposed" so that we don't have to build additional ones
for future buildings. Another interesting fact is, if we only consider the perimeter change of buildings and roads, the average score almost gets back
to the original one. We guess it's more crucial to expose the ponds and fields.
